# dungeons-dragons
In this repository, I'll be trying to design the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game from scratch using Python.

To start the game, you should run the game.py file and simply follow the guidelines.
Remember you have two dependent files(initialize.py and update_move.py) to the main game file, which should be in the same directory.

When the player starts the game, she/he is asked to enter the grid size.
The game randomly chooses an initial place for the player based on the grid size.
There are two other places in the grid("Dragon" and "Dungeon") that are invisible to the player.
The aim of the game is that player should move towards the "Dungeon" without facing the "Dragon".

What are you waiting for?
Good luck then!
